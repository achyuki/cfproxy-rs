  "token": "", // Authentication token
  "host": "127.0.0.1", // SOCKS5 bind address
  "port": 4514, // SOCKS5 bind port
  "user": "", // SOCKS5 username
  "passwd": "", // SOCKS5 password

# Tips

* Due to [issues with Cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/tcp-sockets/#considerations), outbound TCP sockets toÂ Cloudflare IP rangesÂ are temporarily blocked.
* Due to Cloudflare does not support it, UDP proxy is not supported yet.
* ä¸­å›½å¤§é™†ç”¨æˆ·è¯·ä½¿ç”¨ Pages éƒ¨ç½².

## TODO

* [ ] ~~Support UDP proxy/DNS query~~
* [ ] Calling proxychains-ng/graftcp
